# Landmark-Detection-and-Tracking-In-Robots-Using-SLAM
This project is an implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world. We can create a map of the environment of the robot through the combination of motion and sensor data that was gathered over time.  SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
## Example
Below you can see an example of a 50 x 50 grid world with with landmarks (purple x's) and robot position (a red 'o') lcreated by using only sensor and motion data collected from the robot.
